## How to run the program

Run these commands in ur terminal of choice while located in the same folder as this text-file to run the game.

1. gradlew build

2. gradlew run

If you're on a MAC you need to have "./" before each command

if these do not work make sure you have the latest JDK installed as well as a installed 
JAVA_HOME environment and try again
